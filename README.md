# python
Repository for various Python projects that I pursue in my spare time.

Most of these projects will be on Python 3.6.x++, or 'python3' in bash for short.
Things I am interested in using Python for: web scraping, system/file ops, data science stuff,
and general programming paradigms (for learning them).
