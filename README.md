# python-etc
Repository for various Python projects that I pursue in my spare time.

### Basics
Catchall for different projects and code snippets
Some may be rolled into separate repos based on scope

### Things I am interested in using Python for:
* security tools
* web scraping
* system/file op
* data science
* general programming paradigms (for learning them).
